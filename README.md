# Landing-Page
JavaScript Project [Udacity Front End Developer Nanodegree]

### Project Description
Building a multi-section landing page with a dynamic built navigation. When a user clicks on a navigation item, the item can scroll to the appropriate section rather than the default jump. In addition, differentiate a section in a viewport from the rest of sections, add scroll to top button and hide the navigation as user is not longer scrolling to improve the usersâ€™ experience.
